# Bible_clock

This is a project I have been working on and off on for awhile.

The goal is to make something similar to this: https://www.thebibleclock.com/

But instead of charging $200, that is what I believe the price is as of writing this, I wanted to make one much cheaper.

^ pricing is revealed if you give them your email.

I also wanted to try to make mine "available" before theirs, not in the case of I am actively selling them but meaning the guide is available.
